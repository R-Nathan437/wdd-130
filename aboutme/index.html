    <p>
        Hey, my name is Nathan and I'm studying computer science. I'm from Firestone, Colorado; a similar climate to Rexburg.
        I spent the winter learning how to snowboard. I enjoy being active, 
        specifcially playing sports such as volleyball or pickleball. I am single, or also known as not maried.  
        I work at crispy cones. Going into the general feild of "tech", I think web design is an important part of the industry. 
        I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was born, so in all 19 years.
        I look forward to learning what this class has to offer.
    </p>
